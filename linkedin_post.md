Just shipped a refreshed version of my personal portfolio — cleaner, more professional, and packed with UX improvements.

What I updated:
- Professional chatbot with typing animation and auto-scroll for natural conversation flow.
- Global dark theme with a persistent theme toggle and consistent component styling.
- Experience timeline (now supports embedded video) and a certificates gallery with technology tags.
- Custom floating music player: play/pause, skip, seekable progress bar.
- UI polish: hidden scrollbars, floating action shimmer, responsive contact form (modal + page) with sticky mobile footer.

Why this matters: the site now better reflects the quality I bring to projects — clear information architecture, accessible interactions, and a cohesive visual language.

Check it out and tell me what you think — feedback and collaboration welcome.
